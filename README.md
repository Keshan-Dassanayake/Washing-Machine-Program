<h1>Washing Machine Program</h1>

<h2>Description</h2>
This project simulates a user interface (VI) for a washing machine, designed to provide an intuitive and functional control system for users. The interface enables users to select from three distinct washing modes and visually track the washing process in real time. The system incorporates interactive features for turning the machine on/off, selecting modes, and monitoring washing stages.

The washing modes available are:

Colourful Wash
Intensive Wash
Quick Wash
Each mode consists of three stages: Pre-rinse, Main Washing, and Final Spin. The duration for each stage is dynamically adjusted based on the selected mode. Upon completion, the system displays a message indicating that the washing cycle is finished.
